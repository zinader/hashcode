## What is Google Hash Code?

It is Googleâ€™s team-based programming competition, `HashCode`, and it allows you to share your programming and team-work skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through Online Qualifications.

This is the repository for the official website of Google HashCode Documentation at the University of Melbourne.
