## What is Google Hash Code?

It is Google’s team-based programming competition, `HashCode`, and it allows you to share your programming and team-work skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through Online Qualifications.

## How does it work?

- Once you’ve `registered` for the contest, you’ll gain access to our Judge System. 
- The Judge System is our online platform where you’ll form your team, join a Hub, practice, and compete during the rounds. During the Online Qualifications, you’ll watch our YouTube livestream to be introduced to the problem.
- Your team will have four hours to solve an optimization problem using the programming language and tools of your choice. Teams can also compete alongside other teams in your area by joining a virtual Hub. 
- The top teams from the Online Qualifications will be invited to the virtual World Finals, where they’ll work together to solve another challenge and compete for cash prizes.

## Make sure you've Registered

- Individual registration closes on `February 22nd`.
